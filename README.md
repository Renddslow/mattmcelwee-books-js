# Reading List

I wanted a simple way to keep track of books that I want to read, as well as books I've already read and would recommend.

The idea is that anyone could engage with my picks either in this repository via books/ directory, or at my site. Additionally, this repo can be easily forked and your own book added.

A note on the choices herein. These books are largely books that have to do with God, the Church, or the Bible and are more academic in nature. These are part of my own desire to understand more about God and ditch my preconceived categories established through years of tradition. Not every work within will necessarily reflect any whole views on a given subject, but rather help me to understand the broader conversations being had.

## Publishing
This list will be published as part of [my personal GraphQL API](https://api.mattmcelwee.com/graphql) that includes my blog among other things. The data from this repository is compiled into one massive JSON file every time a change is made on the master branch and then pushed to the data folder at the [source for my API](https://github.com/Renddslow/mattmcelwee-graphql-js).
